### Access using API Keys

Sieve uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can access / manage your API keys via your [Sieve dasbhoard](https://app.sievedata.com/).

Sieve expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
