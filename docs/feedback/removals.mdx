<Request method="POST">https://api.sievedata.com/v1/feedback/remove_object</Request>

This endpoint allows the removal of any objects the system incorrectly detected in a video. Feedback is specified in the `removals` parameter in the same format as the payloads returned by the [/query](/query/metadata) endpoint. The system will automatically remove the objects specified and then improve itself automatically based on the feedback.

The `removals` parameter is a list of object ids to remove.
