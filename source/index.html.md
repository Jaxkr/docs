# Introduction

Welcome to the Sieve API! You can use our API to access Sieve API endpoints, which can help you submit images to Sieve to get tagged and later query by ids, timestamps, or subsets.

Our API is currently in Beta, so please [reach out to us](https://sievedata.com/) if you're interested in the API and getting onboarded. We're trying to handle as many customers as possible right now.

> API Endpoint

```python
https://api.sievedata.com/v1/
```

```shell
https://api.sievedata.com/v1/
```
# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```python
from sieve.client import SieveClient

client = SieveClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key.

Sieve uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can access / manage your API keys via your Sieve dasbhoard after you get access.

Sieve expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY`

# Projects

## Initialize a New Project

```python
from sieve.client import SieveClient

client = SieveClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
client.init_project(project_name="amazing_project_1")
```

```shell
curl https://api.sievedata.com/v1/init_project \
    -X POST \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "project_name": "amazing_project_1"
    }'
```

> A sample response would look as follows:

```json
{
    "description": "Created project amazing_project_1",
    "project_id": "18ff75d5-8f7d-4c7b-b3ed-7c66615d9808"
}
```

This endpoint creates a new Sieve project. A new project might be per general problem, per dataset, or however else you want to divide projects. Functionally, all querying will happen within a specific project.

### HTTP Request

`POST https://api.sievedata.com/v1/init_project`

### Parameters

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
```project_name``` | string | the name of the project

<aside class="notice">
A project name is used to access images and tags for that project
</aside>

## Get All Projects

```python
from sieve.client import SieveClient

client = SieveClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
print(client.get_all_projects()) # this prints project names in a list
```

```shell
curl https://api.sievedata.com/v1/get_all_projects \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

> A sample response would look as follows:

```json
{
    "description": "successful",
    "projects": [
        "amazing_project_1",
        "amazing_project_2",
        "amazing_project_x"
    ]
}
```

This endpoint retrieves the names of all projects you've created within your organization.

### Parameters

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
```project_name``` | string | the name of the project
